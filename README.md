AudioData web app is based of Flask framework and Dropbox API used for ML models data gathering.
This project is inspired by Google Open Speech web app, but now Heroku compatible. Also thanks to Dropbox API, there's no need to any other storage for data being uploaded. (The former web app developed by Google team forced US to use google cloud API)
+ The problem of short term Dropbox tokens is solved with a refresh token!



Thanks to the Mozilla team for the [Web Dictaphone sample application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream_Recording_API/Using_the_MediaStream_Recording_API#A_sample_application_Web_Dictaphone)
that I used as a starting point, [Sole](https://soledadpenades.com/) for the
oscilloscope, and the Flask team for a lovely Python microframework!
